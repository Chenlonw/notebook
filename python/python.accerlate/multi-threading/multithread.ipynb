    "[threading](https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html) 相比于[thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htm) 是一个功能更加多样的模块。主要可以利用该模块实现多任务的并行执行，以提高python的执行效率。\n",
    "\n",
    "通常利用 [Producer/Consumer Threading Pattern/scenario](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf)来规划多线程并行问题。Producer 通常用来生成任务并利用 queue 来传递任务给 Consumer， Consumer 一次从queue中认领一个任务并执行。非常类似MPI中的master-slave模式。\n",
